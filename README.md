# Lightshot image snatcher

[Lightshot](https://app.prntscr.com/en/) lets you print-screen and automatically upload images to the internet. The uploaded images' links are sequential, as follows:

- http://prnt.sc/abcde0
- http://prnt.sc/abcde1
- http://prnt.sc/abcde2
- http://prnt.sc/abcde3
- and so on...

This web app exploits the fact the links are sequencial, searching for each link's image and displaying them accordingly.
